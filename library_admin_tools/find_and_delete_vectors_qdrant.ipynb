Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the call and need for Auxiliary \\naugmentation of Coast Guard missions and activities significantly inc reased.  This included a \\nnew and considerable need for Auxiliary augmentation of Coast Guard Culinary S pecialist (CS) \\nactivities in dining facilities and galleys .   \\n '}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=1),\n",

The AUXFS program originated in the First District – Southern Auxiliary Region under \\nthe moniker of the Auxiliary Chef (AUXCHEF) program.  It was established in 2009 to provide  \\ntrained and qualified Auxiliarists to augment and support the Coast Guard CS program as well as Auxiliary food service needs.  In 2013, the program name changed to the AUXFS title.   \\n \\nc. As the AUXFS program expanded its support of Coast Guard galleys and dining \\nfacilities, it also became apparent that opportunities for participation were clearly constrained by geographic proximity to such facilities.  In order to fully leverage the program’s practical utility and its recruiting and retention appeal for all Auxiliarists, the program has been bifurcated to address training and qualification opportunities for Auxiliarists who can apply its competencies to both Coast Guard unit support and Auxiliary unit support.  This yields  its provision for two \\ndistinct competencies  while concurrently undergoing a name change to more closely align with \\nthe Coast Guard’s Culinary Specialist program which it directly supports.  As a result, the AUXCA program now trains and qualifies Auxiliarists in either the AUXCA -1 Specialist or \\nAUXCA- 2 Specialist competency, or both.   \\n \\n5. DISCLAIMER .  This SOP is not a substitute for applicable legal requirements, nor is it itself \\na rule.  It is intended to provide guidance for Auxiliary personnel and is not intended to nor does \\nit impose legally binding requirements on any party outside the Coast Guard. \\n \\n6. MAJOR CHANGES .  None.  \\n \\n7.   DISTRIBUTION .  No paper distribution will be made of this SOP.  Because it contain s the \\nAUXCA Program Personal Qualification Standards (PQS) in enclosure (1) , neither electronic \\nforwarding nor copying is  authorized.  An electronic version  that does not include the  PQS  will \\nbe posted on the  Chief Director of Auxiliary a nd Coast Guard Auxiliary web sites: http://agroup -\\nbx.wow.uscgaux.info/content.php?unit=BX -GROUP   and http://www.cgaux.org/ , respectively .  \\nAll web sites in the SOP are the most current available.

General Guidelines .   \\n \\na. Membership and Activity Expectations.  \\n \\n(1) Pursuant to reference (a), Auxiliarists may participate in the Auxiliary Culinary Assistan ce (AUXCA) program upon successful completion of AUXCA program  \\ntraining , qualification , and assignment of either the AUXCA- 1 Specialist or AUXCA-\\n2 Specialist competency , or both.  Achievement of the AUXCA -1 Specialist \\ncompetency automatically earns the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency.  The reverse is \\nnot true if only the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency is achieved.  \\n \\n(a) AUXCA- 1 Specialist  activities  are authorized to augment and support the Coast \\nGuard Culinary Service (CS) program as well as Auxiliary unit culinary  service \\nneeds.   Such activities include direct support of a Coast Guard galley or dining \\nfacility in the conduct of daily operations, retirement ceremonies, changes of command, and morale events, as well as comparable Auxiliary ceremonial and morale events  like flotilla  Changes of Watch.  \\n  \\n(b) AUXCA- 2 Specialist  activities are authorized to augment and support solely \\nAuxiliary culinary  assistance  needs, and they are meant to improve the \\npreparedness of participating Auxiliarists to achieve the AUXCA- 1 Specialist \\ncompetency.  Such activities include culinary assistance in support of Auxiliary \\nunit ceremonial and morale events like Auxiliary unit Changes of Watch , picnics, \\netc.  However, possessing the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency is not a \\nrequirement fo r any Auxiliarist to provide direct support to such Auxiliary unit \\nculinary  assistance needs.   \\n (2) The nature and scope of the AUXCA- 1 Specialist competency  is limited by the finite \\nnumber of Coast Guard galleys and dining facilities that need AUXCA program  \\nsupport at any given time.  Thus Auxiliarists must understand that AUXCA -1 \\nSpecialist training, qualification, and support activity opportunities may not always be sufficient to accommodate the Auxiliary interest in a specific geographic area.  Auxiliarists should therefore explore the likelihood and sufficiency of these opportunities before pursuing AUXCA -1 Specialist training and qualification.  Local \\nAUXCA program management must  strive to ensure that AUXCA -1 Specialist \\nactivity opportunities are planned and scheduled to maximize the number of AUXCA program  participants who  remain engaged and current in the AUXCA -1 Specialist \\ncompetency . \\n \\n(3) The nature and scope of the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency is also limited by the \\nfinite number of Auxiliary unit events that require culinary service.  Although the \\nAUXCA- 2 Specialist competency is not required to directly support Auxiliary unit \\nculinary service needs, Auxiliarists who possess the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency \\nshould be fully leveraged to support such needs whenever they are willing and available to do so.

The DSO -CA shall \\ncoordinate regional AUXCA program  support in response to requests from Coast \\nGuard units as well as requests for AUXCA program  support for major Auxiliary and \\nother agency/organization events  within their regional area of responsibility .  \\nAccordingly, requests for such AUXCA program  support shall be forwarded to the \\nDSO- CA for coordination. \\n \\n(3) Division -level AUXCA program management is authorized to be performed by a \\nDivision Staff Officer  for Culinary Assist ance (SO -CA).   The SO -CA shall coordinate  \\nAUXCA program  support in response to requests from local Coast Guard units, \\nAuxiliary  units, and other agencies/organizations  within their divisional area of \\nresponsibility .  Accordingly, requests for such AUXCA support shall be forwarded to \\nthe cognizant SO -CA for coordination and in collaboration with the DSO -CA.  The \\nSO-CA is authorized to interview applicants for AUXCA program  training, determine \\ntheir intent and desire to support the Coast Guard CS program a s an AUXCA- 1 \\nSpecialist , and either deny or approve their start of AUXCA program  training in \\naccordance with section 2.a.(1)( c) of this SOP.  \\n \\n(4) A flotilla level staff office for AUXCA program management is not authorized. \\n \\n(5) Auxiliary Culinary Assistan ce Speci alists  are authorized to be assigned to duty \\npursuant to section 2.B. of reference (a).  They are therefore authorized to perform, claim activity hours , and be recognized for their AUXCA program  activities in \\nsupport of official Coast Guard and Auxiliary e vents and operations.  A  Coast Guard \\nunit that has a dining facility or galley that needs AUXCA program support shall \\nnormally serve as an AUXCA- 1 Specialist’s  Order Issuing Authority (OIA) for \\npurposes of the  AUXCA program  support provided to it.  Auxiliary leaders and \\nprogram managers may serve as OIA for AUXCA -2 Specialists  in accordance with \\nsections 4.F and 4.G of reference (a).   \\n \\nc.  Program Goals.  The AUXCA program has several goals for its participants and the Coast \\nGuard and Auxiliary units they serve : \\n \\n(1) To provide high -quality and timely culinary  service support to Coast Guard and \\nAuxiliary units.

To establish  Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the conduct of the Auxiliary \\nCulinary Assistan ce (AUXCA)  program  pursuant to authorities a nd policies in references (a) -(g).   \\n \\n2.

Auxiliary AUXCA national program managers shall ma intain close liaison with the Coast \\nGuard Auxiliary  Division (CG -BSX -1) for the purpose of general AUXCA programmatic advice \\nand guidance including matter s of per form ance standards and expectations.     \\n  \\n3.

Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the call and need for Auxiliary \\naugmentation of Coast Guard missions and activities significantly inc reased.  This included a \\nnew and considerable need for Auxiliary augmentation of Coast Guard Culinary S pecialist (CS) \\nactivities in dining facilities and galleys .   \\n '}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=1),\n",

The AUXFS program originated in the First District – Southern Auxiliary Region under \\nthe moniker of the Auxiliary Chef (AUXCHEF) program.  It was established in 2009 to provide  \\ntrained and qualified Auxiliarists to augment and support the Coast Guard CS program as well as Auxiliary food service needs.  In 2013, the program name changed to the AUXFS title.   \\n \\nc. As the AUXFS program expanded its support of Coast Guard galleys and dining \\nfacilities, it also became apparent that opportunities for participation were clearly constrained by geographic proximity to such facilities.  In order to fully leverage the program’s practical utility and its recruiting and retention appeal for all Auxiliarists, the program has been bifurcated to address training and qualification opportunities for Auxiliarists who can apply its competencies to both Coast Guard unit support and Auxiliary unit support.  This yields  its provision for two \\ndistinct competencies  while concurrently undergoing a name change to more closely align with \\nthe Coast Guard’s Culinary Specialist program which it directly supports.  As a result, the AUXCA program now trains and qualifies Auxiliarists in either the AUXCA -1 Specialist or \\nAUXCA- 2 Specialist competency, or both.   \\n \\n5. DISCLAIMER .  This SOP is not a substitute for applicable legal requirements, nor is it itself \\na rule.  It is intended to provide guidance for Auxiliary personnel and is not intended to nor does \\nit impose legally binding requirements on any party outside the Coast Guard. \\n \\n6. MAJOR CHANGES .  None.  \\n \\n7.   DISTRIBUTION .  No paper distribution will be made of this SOP.  Because it contain s the \\nAUXCA Program Personal Qualification Standards (PQS) in enclosure (1) , neither electronic \\nforwarding nor copying is  authorized.  An electronic version  that does not include the  PQS  will \\nbe posted on the  Chief Director of Auxiliary a nd Coast Guard Auxiliary web sites: http://agroup -\\nbx.wow.uscgaux.info/content.php?unit=BX -GROUP   and http://www.cgaux.org/ , respectively .  \\nAll web sites in the SOP are the most current available.

Such activities include direct support of a Coast Guard galley or dining \\nfacility in the conduct of daily operations, retirement ceremonies, changes of command, and morale events, as well as comparable Auxiliary ceremonial and morale events  like flotilla  Changes of Watch.  \\n  \\n(b) AUXCA- 2 Specialist  activities are authorized to augment and support solely \\nAuxiliary culinary  assistance  needs, and they are meant to improve the \\npreparedness of participating Auxiliarists to achieve the AUXCA- 1 Specialist \\ncompetency.  Such activities include culinary assistance in support of Auxiliary \\nunit ceremonial and morale events like Auxiliary unit Changes of Watch , picnics, \\netc.  However, possessing the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency is not a \\nrequirement fo r any Auxiliarist to provide direct support to such Auxiliary unit \\nculinary  assistance needs.   \\n (2) The nature and scope of the AUXCA- 1 Specialist competency  is limited by the finite \\nnumber of Coast Guard galleys and dining facilities that need AUXCA program  \\nsupport at any given time.  Thus Auxiliarists must understand that AUXCA -1 \\nSpecialist training, qualification, and support activity opportunities may not always be sufficient to accommodate the Auxiliary interest in a specific geographic area.  Auxiliarists should therefore explore the likelihood and sufficiency of these opportunities before pursuing AUXCA -1 Specialist training and qualification.  Local \\nAUXCA program management must  strive to ensure that AUXCA -1 Specialist \\nactivity opportunities are planned and scheduled to maximize the number of AUXCA program  participants who  remain engaged and current in the AUXCA -1 Specialist \\ncompetency . \\n \\n(3) The nature and scope of the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency is also limited by the \\nfinite number of Auxiliary unit events that require culinary service.  Although the \\nAUXCA- 2 Specialist competency is not required to directly support Auxiliary unit \\nculinary service needs, Auxiliarists who possess the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency \\nshould be fully leveraged to support such needs whenever they are willing and available to do so.

Effective today, AUXDATA II has a new functionality to track the issuance and maintenance of issued Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The PPE function can be accessed from the Member Record on the PPE tab. In order to utilize the PPE functions, selected Auxiliarists will need specific PPE Manager permissions to enter PPE data and manage the PPE process. These selected Auxiliarists will likely be the same people who currently track PPE issuance and maintenance per reference (a). Only District Directors of Auxiliary (DIRAU X) or Operations Training Officers (OTO) can grant PPE Manager Permissions. \\n2. The Office of Auxiliary and Boating Safety (CG -BSX) will work with DIRAUX offices to begin the \\nprocess of training PPE Managers to enter PPE information into AUXDATA II. This ef fort will be a \\nphased -in approach to ensure the PPE design is working as intended and to make improvements based on \\ninitial user feedback. If your DIRAUX office has not given you PPE Manager permissions, please be patient. This will be a significant effort for PPE Managers to learn the process and to enter all of the PPE that is already in circulation in the field. We anticipate that it will likely take between 6 -12 months to get \\nall issued PPE entered into AUXDATA II.  \\n3.

The following changes to REF (A) are in immediate effect:  \\n   a. Section 3.C.2. Types and Durations of Personnel Security Investigations (PSI):   There \\nare three types of Auxiliary PSIs:  \\n     (1) Operational Support (OS). Applicable for entry level  membership and most activities. \\nMust be completed with a Favorable determination prior to enrollment or re -enrollment, \\nregardless if the applicant possesses a current Favorable PSI from any federal agency, as well as on an annual basis t hereafter.  \\n     (2) Direct Informational (DI). Applicable for Auxiliarists who  require logical access to \\nCoast Guard Standard Work Stations (SWS)  and/or networks (i.e., the dot mil domain) due \\nto the nature of the  support that they provide to a Coast Guard unit.   \\n     (3) Direct Operational (DO). Applicable for more advanced and mission sensitive activities that require an Auxiliarist to hold a security clearance or be security clearance-ready.   \\n   Favorable OS, DI, and DO PSI determinations reflect an individual's suitability for different types of service in the Auxiliary as defined in sections C.2.a, C.2.b, and C.2.c of this chapter.  At a minimum, applicants for enrollment and re -enrollment must submit to and \\nundergo an OS PSI which is a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Crime Information Center Interstate Identification Index (NCIC -III) check. Appropriate paperwork \\nto properly conduct the OS PSI must be included as part of any enrollment and re -\\nenrollment package submission. A DI PSI package  requires submission of fingerprints in \\naddition to an SF -85 (Questionnaire for Non- Sensitive Positions) package to complete its \\nTier 1 -level PSI (i.e. old National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI)). A DO PSI package \\nrequires submission of fingerprints in addition to an SF -86 (Questionnaire for National \\nSecurity Positions)  to complete its Tier 3 -level PSI (i.e. old National Agency Check with \\nLaw and Credit (NACLC)).  \\n   If an applicant or member has  undergone a previous DI or DO PSI performed by a federal \\nagency,  is still within its effective period, and can provide appropriate  source \\ndocumentation, then the applicant or member must include a  copy of such documentation \\nfor Coast Guard Security Center (SECCEN) validation in lieu of standard PSI documents in order to avoid having to undergo an entirely new DI or DO PSI process.  \\n   Favorable  DI and DO PSI determinations reflect readiness for the granting of  more \\nextensive access within Coast Guard information systems and to  classified information, \\nrespectively . Favorable DI and DO PSI  determinations do not have an expiration date unless \\nthe Auxiliarist is granted a security clearance in which case applicable security clearance \\nrenewal and associated PSI update  requirements apply. An Auxiliarist with a Favorable  DI \\nor DO PSI  may otherwise retain that PSI status indefinitely without further  review unless \\notherwise directed by the Coast Guard. Auxiliarists  with a Favorable DI or a DO PSI must \\nstill participate in the  annual NCIC -III check.  \\n   b. Section 3.C.2.a.

The last major Auxiliary uniform policy change stemmed from discontinuance of the Work \\nBlue and Undress Blue uniforms in 2012.  Authorization of an entirely new Auxiliary \\nuniform has not occurred since introduction of the ODU as the Coast Guard’s principal \\nwork uniform in 2004.  The Coast Guard’s transition to the CG-U over the next couple of years will be constrained by a limited range of available sizes for all service members authorized to wear it, including Auxiliarists.   While this will trigger discontinuance of the \\nODU from Auxiliary wear, it will also warrant establishment of a new  alternative  Auxiliary \\nWork Uniform (AWU) that will be  significantly different in  appearance from  the ODU and \\nCG-U.     \\n c.  The  Auxiliary’s transition to the CG -U and e stablishment  of a new alternative AWU  present \\nan appropriate opportunity to concurrently assess new Auxiliary uniform and appearance \\npolicies .

The AUXFS program originated in the First District – Southern Auxiliary Region under \\nthe moniker of the Auxiliary Chef (AUXCHEF) program.  It was established in 2009 to provide  \\ntrained and qualified Auxiliarists to augment and support the Coast Guard CS program as well as Auxiliary food service needs.  In 2013, the program name changed to the AUXFS title.   \\n \\nc. As the AUXFS program expanded its support of Coast Guard galleys and dining \\nfacilities, it also became apparent that opportunities for participation were clearly constrained by geographic proximity to such facilities.  In order to fully leverage the program’s practical utility and its recruiting and retention appeal for all Auxiliarists, the program has been bifurcated to address training and qualification opportunities for Auxiliarists who can apply its competencies to both Coast Guard unit support and Auxiliary unit support.  This yields  its provision for two \\ndistinct competencies  while concurrently undergoing a name change to more closely align with \\nthe Coast Guard’s Culinary Specialist program which it directly supports.  As a result, the AUXCA program now trains and qualifies Auxiliarists in either the AUXCA -1 Specialist or \\nAUXCA- 2 Specialist competency, or both.   \\n \\n5. DISCLAIMER .

Reference ( b) establishes Coast Guard  policy to support national youth programs, such as \\nSea Scouts of the BSA, with oversight by the Office of Public Affairs, Community Relations \\nBranch (CG -09232). Sea Scouts  is a youth program supported by the Coast Guard . Sea Scouts \\nare authorized to use training and recreation facilities at Coast Guard facilities and to participate in Coast Guard cruises and air operations at the discretion of Commanding O fficers or O fficer s-\\nin-Charge, with approval of the District C ommander, and in accordance with applicable Coast \\nGuard policies.   \\n \\nc.  The Coast Guard Auxiliary traditionally exercised limited partnership with youth \\norganizations pursuant to provisions of references (c) and (d). It concurrently shared with the Sea Scouts a strong mutual respect and appreciation for the benefits gained from leadership education and development programs among youth who possess maritime interests. Both organizations had a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) since 2009 that allow ed their  units to \\npartner on a variety of projects including shore- side RBS  activities on a case -by-case basis.   \\n \\nd.  Close cooperative examination by  the Auxiliary and the Sea Scouts identified \\nsignificantly beneficial prospects of enhancing their partnership including improved Sea Scout training opportunities, enriched Coast Guard and Auxiliary recruiting, and better overall promotion of recreational boating safety among our Nation’s boating public. This led to MOA revision in 2018 that provides for AUXSCOUT program development and implementation .  \\n \\n5.  DISCLAIMER .

Hot Weather Uniform (HWU) versions of the ODU and AWU are also \\nauthorized for wear if regionally authorized for such activities .  For example, members of \\na boat crew may wear different uniforms on the same patrol.  Wearing different uniforms \\nunder such circumstances is encouraged in order to help seek and obtain feedback from \\nthe public, Coast Guard personnel, and from fellow Auxiliarists about e ach uniform’s \\nappearance, durability, approachability, and preference.  \\n \\nf.

Achievement of the AUXCA -1 Specialist \\ncompetency automatically earns the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency.  The reverse is \\nnot true if only the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency is achieved.  \\n \\n(a) AUXCA- 1 Specialist  activities  are authorized to augment and support the Coast \\nGuard Culinary Service (CS) program as well as Auxiliary unit culinary  service \\nneeds.   Such activities include direct support of a Coast Guard galley or dining \\nfacility in the conduct of daily operations, retirement ceremonies, changes of command, and morale events, as well as comparable Auxiliary ceremonial and morale events  like flotilla  Changes of Watch.  \\n  \\n(b) AUXCA- 2 Specialist  activities are authorized to augment and support solely \\nAuxiliary culinary  assistance  needs, and they are meant to improve the \\npreparedness of participating Auxiliarists to achieve the AUXCA- 1 Specialist \\ncompetency.  Such activities include culinary assistance in support of Auxiliary \\nunit ceremonial and morale events like Auxiliary unit Changes of Watch , picnics, \\netc.  However, possessing the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency is not a \\nrequirement fo r any Auxiliarist to provide direct support to such Auxiliary unit \\nculinary  assistance needs.   \\n (2) The nature and scope of the AUXCA- 1 Specialist competency  is limited by the finite \\nnumber of Coast Guard galleys and dining facilities that need AUXCA program  \\nsupport at any given time.  Thus Auxiliarists must understand that AUXCA -1 \\nSpecialist training, qualification, and support activity opportunities may not always be sufficient to accommodate the Auxiliary interest in a specific geographic area.  Auxiliarists should therefore explore the likelihood and sufficiency of these opportunities before pursuing AUXCA -1 Specialist training and qualification.  Local \\nAUXCA program management must  strive to ensure that AUXCA -1 Specialist \\nactivity opportunities are planned and scheduled to maximize the number of AUXCA program  participants who  remain engaged and current in the AUXCA -1 Specialist \\ncompetency . \\n \\n(3) The nature and scope of the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency is also limited by the \\nfinite number of Auxiliary unit events that require culinary service.  Although the \\nAUXCA- 2 Specialist competency is not required to directly support Auxiliary unit \\nculinary service needs, Auxiliarists who possess the AUXCA -2 Specialist competency \\nshould be fully leveraged to support such needs whenever they are willing and available to do so.

Introduction to Social Media.  \\na.  What is Social Media? \\n \\n(1)  The Department of Homeland Security defines social media as  the sphere of \\nwebsites, applications, and web-based tools that connect users to engage in dialogue, share information and media, collaborate, and interact. Social media take many different forms, including but not limited to web-based communities and hosted services, social networking sites, video and photo sharing sites, blogs, virtual worlds, social bookmarking, and other emerging technologies. \\n \\n(2)  Social  media  provides an  avenue to  bridge time  and distance to  facilitate  \\ncommunications among people with  various backgrounds and  geographic locations.  \\nIt has become an integral part of our everyday  life and is an in valuable \\ncommunication tool in the 21st century .   \\n \\n(3)  Over  80 percent  of Americans use social media, with the majority on a daily basis. In \\n2023, it was  reported there were  over 4.9 billion active users globally. This was an \\nexponential and phenomenal increase from 2005 when modern- day social media \\nusage was only about seven percent  of the population (Pew Research Center) . \\n \\nb.  Social  Media and  the Coast  Guard  Auxiliary  \\n \\n(1)  Social  media , which  falls under Coast  Guard  public affairs  program  management , \\ngreatly  enhances our ability to  tell the Coast  Guard  and Coast  Guard  Auxiliary \\nstories via text,  imagery,  graphics, and  video. It is used as an avenue to  connect  with  \\nthe boating public and  disseminate  valuable content in  several  mission  areas . \\nAlthough Auxiliary  units are not required  to have a social  media  presence, unlike \\nmost websites,  social  media  is dynamic and  immediate . It allows  two-way, \\nsynchronous communication , and  feedback  with  our stakeholders in  an \\nunprecedented  fashion. \\n \\n(2)  With  the benefit  of adding social  media  to the public affairs  toolkit, we  also have the \\nresponsibility  to understand the guidelines and  ramifications . Official  guidelines and  \\npolic ies have not wholly kept up with  ever -changing technologies . Guidance must \\nevolve as  social  media use increases  among Auxiliary units. \\n \\n(3)  In 2021, the Coast  Guard  released the updated  reference  (c) to which  the Auxiliary  \\ncurrently  adheres.  The Auxiliary  also follows the policies  and procedures in  Section \\n5.R. of reference (a)  as well as those of references (b) and  (d).  \\n \\n'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=5),\n",

Article VIII in the Standardized Standing  Rules for flotillas \\nand divisions, and Article X in the Standardized Standing  Rules for district s also \\nprescribes  responsibilities  for the Flotilla Staff Officer for Finance (FSO -FN), Division \\nStaff Officer for Finance (SO -FN), and District Staff Officer for Finance (DSO -FN), \\nrespectively.   Auxiliary unit leaders shall appoint a unit FN staff officer within  30 days of \\nassuming elected office.  Neither the unit FN staff officer  nor any appointed assistant \\nshall be familial- related to the current elected leader, vice leader, or immediate past \\nleader of their unit or any other unit in their C hain of Leadership (COL) .   \\n \\nb. Concurrent Elected and Appointed Finance or Materials Staff Office s.  \\n \\n(1) In accordance with reference (e), an incumbent elected officer at any organizational \\nlevel shall not concurrently serve as a unit  FN staff officer at any organiz ational level.  \\nIf a member is not available to serve as the unit FN staff officer or there is no \\neffective way for the unit to comply, then the cognizant District Director of Auxiliary (DIRAUX ) may grant a waiver for an elected officer to be appointed to fill the unit \\nFN staff office .  Such appointee shall functionally report to the unit FN staff officer at \\ntheir next higher organizational level and shall keep the elected leader at their next higher organizational level apprised of any negative impacts on their elected office performance as they develop.  For  example, if the Flotilla Vice Commander (VFC) \\nmust also serve as the FSO -FN, then they must functionally report to the SO -FN for \\nmatters of their finance officer duties and immediately notify their Division \\nCommander (DCDR) of any negative impacts. The Chief Director of Auxiliary \\n(CHDIRAUX) may similarly waive this prohibition for elected and finance -related \\noffices at the national level . \\n \\n(2) This provision does not affect elected office eligibility criteria.  It is understood, though, that  if an Auxiliarist serving in a unit FN staff office  is elected to an elected \\noffice, then they must relinquish that unit FN staff office position prior to \\ncommencing their term of elected office unless a waiver has been granted.   \\n \\n(3) Similarly, if an elected officer needs, or is otherwise compelled to assume the duties \\nof a unit FN staff office , then they must relinquish their elected office before doing so \\nunless a waiver has been granted  by the DIRAUX.   \\n \\n(4) Waivers for t hese circumstances shall not exceed one year and shall only be granted \\nby the DIRAUX upon validation of need by the District Commodore (DCO).  For example, the need for waiver to allow a Division Vice Commander ( VCDR ) to serve \\nas SO -FN must be validated by  the DCO to the DIRAUX (email acceptable)).

Social Media Security . \\n \\n\"All personnel have a responsibility to ensure that sensitive information is not posted.\" \\nSection 6.E.4. of reference (b)  \\n \\na. Whether  on official  or unofficial  social  media  pages , security  awareness  involving social  \\nmedia  platforms  and posts takes top priority  to help  protect  the safety  of Team  Coast  \\nGuard  members  and operations. The  use of social  media  exposes us to  increasing  digital \\nrisks  and challenges.  Criminal and foreign adversaries have been known to scour \\nplatforms and accounts for the purpose of gathering information, making us more \\nvulnerable. \\n \\nb. Even though Coast Guard Pu blic Affairs policy states, \"Maximum disclosure  with \\nminimum delay,\" take the time necessary to ensure information is suitable for social \\nmedia release. Ensure the post content is accurate and does not violate policy or privacy.   \\n \\nc. If posting images of or from active -duty units or facilities, the O fficer-In-C harge (OINC) \\nor Commanding O fficer  (CO), via their chain of command, must approve the use of such \\nimages or information in any and all media. They are the information release authority.  \\n \\nd. You are expected  to properly  secure your accounts  and carefully  follow Operations  \\nSecurity  (OPSEC),  Security, Accuracy, Policy, and Propriety (SAPP), Controlled \\nUnclassified Information (CUI), and Privacy Act of 1974 restrictions.  \\n \\ne. Never release information  on social media that violates OPSEC or national security. Do  \\nnot post operations information  on an  official  page or your personal timeline  when  \\nactively  engaged  in those operations. That  would be an  example of an  OPSEC  violation  \\nand could jeopardize the safety of members and operations.  \\n \\nf. Be vigilant protecting yourself, fellow  members , and family.  Adversaries  collect  \\nintelligence  via social  media.  Do not tag  yourself or  other members  on an official  Coast  \\nGuard  or Auxiliary  social  media  post/page, and  do not share social  media  posts from  \\npersonal timelines  to an official  page.  Both situations lead  to an individual\\'s private \\ntimeline , potentially  reve aling personally identifiable information (PII ). It can also \\ndirectly  identif y the military  affiliation  of a member  to anyone on the internet. If there is  \\nopen (public) information on the member\\'s  personal  timeline,  names and  photos of family  \\nmembers  and resident  locations can  be exposed.  \\n \\ng. The disclosure of personal information on official  social media  is subject to the \\nprovisions contained in the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act, with certain \\nexceptions, prohibits the disclosure, distribution, dissemination, or copying of any \\ninformation  containing home addresses, home telephone numbers, spouses’ names, \\nSocial Security numbers, and other personal information.   \\n \\nh. Follow SAPP restrictions when posting. It is  helpful to determine if certain information \\ncan be released via social media.  '}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=7),\n",

We  need  to present  content and  responses in  a \\nprofessional manner, reflecting  our core values  and command  messages.

Social  media  management  is often  more  complex  than  many  realize.  Unit commanders  \\nmust take into  account  resources  and training  when  considering a social  media  presence.  \\nOnly create a social media page if you have trained  Auxiliary staff to manage and \\nmonitor it on a consistent basis. \\n \\nc.  Unit leaders must include social media management during periods of unit leadership \\ntransition. Consider :  \\n \\n(1)  S taffing . \\n \\n(2)  Staff turnover. \\n \\n(3)  Familiarizing new staff/leaders with existing pages. \\n \\n(4)  Assessing c onsistent administration and  monitoring of pages. \\n \\n(5)  Optimizing effectiveness of your social media presence. \\n \\n(6)  Adding administrators  and providing logins to new staff/leader s while  removing \\nprevious staff. Change passwords.        \\n \\nd.  If an  Auxiliary  unit at  any organizational level  within  a district/region  creates  a social  \\nmedia  account of any  sort, then  the District Commodores shall  appoint an  Assistant  \\nDistrict Staff  Officer for Public Affairs  - Social  Media (ADSO- PA-SM) to help  manage \\nand monitor such  social  media  accounts. An  ADSO- PA-SM must be well -versed  on \\nCoast  Guard  and Auxiliary  social  media  policy and  guidelines, and  not be the DSO- PA.  \\n'}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=10),\n",

Understanding that a significant excess accumulation of funds \\ncan stem from diverse circumstances (e.g., instantly in the case of a gift receipt; \\nconsistent growth over the course of several years), an Auxiliary unit’s elected leader in \\nsuch situation is  strongly encouraged to advise their COL to the Executive Committee \\n(EXCOM) level.  The COL is respons ible for providing insight and guidance that \\nconstructively leverages and applies excess funds  in alignment with strategic \\norganizational goals.  Consultation with Coast Guard units directly supported by the \\nAuxiliary unit should also be considered to help shape insight and guidance .      \\n \\ni. Grants , Gifts,  and Contracts .   \\n \\n(1) The procedures for solicitations  and gifts  can be found in Section H of reference (a).  \\nAn Auxiliary unit elected leader should consult the DSO -LP prior to soliciting a gift \\nor accepting an unsolicited gift.  \\n \\n(2) There are numerous sources from which grants are available.  The primary concern \\nabout a grant is whether the proposed source of the grant is a prohibited source.  Such \\nconcern requires a prohibited source determination.  The criteria for determining \\nwhether a source is a prohibited source is found in Appendix D of reference (a).  An \\nAuxiliary unit elected leader should consult the DSO -LP prior to pursuing a grant.       \\n \\n(3) The AuxA possesses extensive organic grant -writing experience and skill among its \\nstaff.  It provides a readily available resource for Auxiliary units to consult with in the \\ndevelopment of any grant application.  \\n \\n(4) Grant  agreements  and contracts , regardless of the unit level, must be submitted to the \\nDSO- LP for review and approval prior to signing.   Prior to communicating approval \\nto the unit, the DSO -LP shall first provide a copy of the grant application to the DCO \\nand D IRAUX, notify them of their intent to approve, and receive acknowledgement \\nof receipt (email acceptable).       \\n \\n(5) No grant agreement or contract may contain an “Indemnification and Hold Harmless \\nClause.”  Such clauses shift liability for specified occurrences from one party to \\nanother.  An  Auxiliarist who signs  on behalf of the Auxiliary unit effectively \\nrepresents t hat they have the authority to shift certain liability onto  the Auxiliary \\nunit.  No member of the Auxiliary has the authority to do that, so signing such an \\nagreement could result in a claim directly against the Auxiliarist.  \\n \\n(6) Any grant  agreement  or contract must be signed by the unit ’s elected leader .  The unit \\nelected  leader  may only sign such agreements or contracts after review and approval \\nby the DSO -LP.   \\n \\n(7) The Auxiliary EIN  shall be used whenever  any grant  agreement or contract calls for \\nan EIN .  A p ersonal Social S ecurity Number (SSN) should never be used because the \\nIRS may hold the individual personally accountable for any taxes that may be due.  \\nThe use of an EIN  belonging to any other organization or corporation for any \\nAuxiliary purpose is strictly prohibited.

Identification as affiliated with the C oast Guard may be as a result of past site \\nactivity, photos of themselves, or other indirect activity. Even when off-duty, and on a personal site or blog, Coast Guard military personnel are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice and civilian employees are subject to administrative or legal action if they violate policy or security regulations.  \\n \\nb.  All Coast Guard personnel are responsible for any statements, comments, or blogs posted \\nunder their name. Personnel are not shielded from legal action for libel or other violations of the personal rights of others.  \\n \\nc.  Auxiliarists  are subject to  and abide by Coast  Guard  policy. Auxiliary  social  media  \\npolic ies effectively  align  with those for other Coast  Guard  personnel. \\n \\nd.  Section 5.R. of reference (a)  addresses Auxiliary s ocial m edia policy. It states  whether in \\na personal capacity or assigned to duty, Auxiliarists are expected to ensure their use of \\nsocial media , \"…neither  inadvertently nor deliberately connects or a ssociates, or projects \\nan image of connection or association with, inappropriate material that is not consistent \\nwith the Coast Guard\\'s C ore V alues and Ethos.\"  \\n \\ne.  There are various other rules  and responsibilities  that come with  official  or unofficial use \\nof social  media  as an Auxiliarist. We must be vigilant in  acting  professionally online at  \\nall times.  Auxiliarists  must always consider how their posts will reflect upon the Coast \\nGuard, the Auxiliary, and themselves. \\n \\nf.  You  can assume  anything posted is  public. Even  if your personal Facebook  timeline  is set \\nto \"friends  only,\" there is  still an  audience.

A uniform item shall be considered  no longer serviceable when any aspect of it is \\nirreparably damaged, soiled, stained, frayed, worn, discolored, faded, or altered. All Auxiliarists, particularly those in leadership positions, have the responsibility to render judgments and take appropriat e action regarding adherence to the Coast Guard’s high \\nstandards of appearance relative to the serviceability of uniform items as worn by themselves and their fellow Auxiliarists.  \\n Although Auxiliarists are not required to closely adhere to Coast Guard  appearance standards (e.g., weight standards, grooming \\nstandards) on a daily basis, circumstances may arise in which close adherence to standards is expected. For example, assignment to duty at a Coast Guard training facility for recruits, enlisted leaders, or new officers carries an implicit expectation that Auxiliarists closely adhere to Coast Guard standards of appearance in order to sustain and support the examples that are strived and set for these groups. Particular attention shall be paid by Auxiliary leaders to ensure that Auxiliary representatives in such circumstances adhere as closely as practicable to Coast Guard grooming, weight, and overall appearance  standards. \\nConsiderable deviation from these standards would not be  \\nappropriate in such circumstances, and it should give cause to \\nAuxiliary  leaders to consider the propriety of allowing an \\nAuxiliarist who does not closely adhere to them to so serve.   \\nThey must also hold membership accountable for maint aining \\nthe same high standards.

The basic unit in Sea Scouting is called the “Ship.” Ships are sponsored by a Chartered \\nOrganization and many are chartered by religious institutions, schools, businesses, local \\nmaritime organizations, yacht clubs, or not- for-profit corporations. A Ship must have at least \\nfive Sea Scouts and five adult leaders.  \\n \\n2. A Ship is led by youths who are elected to the positions of Boatswain, Boatswain’s Mate, \\nCrew Leader, Assistant Crew Leader, Yeoman, Purser, and Storekeeper. A Skipper and Mates assist and advise the youth leaders hip. The Ship Committee is a group of adults led by \\nthe Ship Committee Chair. The Committee supports the Ship program, and manages record keeping, finance, and registration. A limiting factor in organizing and supporting new Ships is recruiting knowledgeab le adult leadership and providing suitable vessels to support the \\nShip’s program. The cost of owning vessels, including title, registration, insurance, dockage, and maintenance is borne by the Ship or its C hartered Organization.  \\n \\n3. Above the level of the Sh ip, BSA has local Councils, National Service Territories, and \\nthe National Committee. A council may have one or more Sea Scout Ships. If there are enough Ships, the Council has a Council Sea Scout Committee which holds regattas, training days, events, long cruises, leadership development training, multi-Ship sails and barbecues, and much more. Several Councils in a geographic area are supported by a BSA “National Service Territory” (NST). NSTs typically have an NST Commodore and NST Boatswain and are often multi-state in size and scope. NSTs typically hold regattas, rendezvous, training weekends, safety -at-sea events, long cruises, Sea Scout advancement academies, and other \\nevents. Depending on the NST, they may also hold SEAL (Sea Scout Advanced Leadership) Training, Seabadge training, Bridges of Honor, and Sea Scout Balls.  \\n \\n4. The National Sea Scout Support Committee’s (NSSC) mission is to develop, enhance, \\nand expand the Sea Scout program in a manner that emphasizes the Boy Scouts of America’s purposes. Committee members are appointed by the National Sea Scout Commodore and Director upon approval of the individual’s council and serve for one- year terms. The \\nCommodore may appoint a National Boatswain from among the youth members with the approval of the individual’s council. NST Commodores serve as ex-officio members of the committee. The committee is made up of six action groups: Communications and  \\nTechnology, Ship Growth and Retention, Marketing, Operations and  Administration, \\nProgram Support, and Relationships. \\n \\n  '}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=18),\n",

It is important to regularly  post on your social media page. Consistent posting is crucial to \\ngain an audience and attract interest. If you are having a difficult time creating original \\ncontent, share interesting content from other Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, and \\ngovernment pages which may have pertinent information. The National Safe Boating \\nCouncil and Safe Boating Campaign  websites  are excellent resources for downloadable \\nand usable safe boating content for creating social media  posts. \\n \\nf.  The following instructions are general information for creating social media pages , though \\nthere is more than one method. Social media platforms change periodically, so these \\ninstructions can quickly become outdated. Alternatively, y ou can do an internet search for \\ninstructions . Sample search criteria might include, \"How to create a Twitter page in 202 3.\" \\nIt helps to designate the year or you may get old instructions. T he most accurate method is \\nto use the help feature on the platform of choice. \\n \\ng.  Also, since platform features  often change, it is best to visit the platform to decide what \\npage features you want to utilize.  \\n \\nh.  The  Social  Media Creation  Process . \\n \\n(1)  Request  and obtain unit leadership  and DSO- PA approval before  creating  a page for \\nyour unit.  \\n \\n(2)  Report previously created pages through your public a ffairs program leadership up to \\nthe DSO -PA. \\n \\n(3)  Conduct a thorough search  for old pages  before  creating  a new  one. If your unit \\nalready  has a page or account in  its name,  make every  effort  to contact  the \\nadministrator  to take over the page before creating  a new  one. In some instances,  you \\ncan claim  the page via platform  guidelines, but it is  difficult to  accomplish.  Do not \\ncreate a new page,  until the old page is  in your control. \\n \\n(4)  Maintain  brand identity  across  channels.  Consistent naming of social  media  pages  \\nwill exist  nationwide. Social  media  pages  are an official  representation  of the Coast  \\nGuard  and the Auxiliary.  \\n \\n(5)  Do  not use nicknames  or informal  names.  Begin  the page name with U.S.  Coast  \\nGuard  Auxiliary  followed by your unit name.  Never  use the name U.S.  Coast Guard  \\nAuxiliary  alone.  That  name  is reserved  for and assigned  to the main  national  social  \\nmedia  page . If using unit numbers, start  with  U.S.  Coast  Guard  Auxiliary, add a \\nlocation  (as listed  in the Auxiliary  Directory ), then unit number if  desired.  Unit \\nnumbers are not required  (e.g., “ U.S. Coast  Guard  Auxiliary  Flotilla  Vancouver  \\nWA” and  “U.S. Coast  Guard  Auxiliary  Thirteenth District”) . Do not use a f lotilla  or \\ndivision  number alone as  there is  sometimes  more  than  one unit assigned  the same \\nnumber in  different  states , plus the general  public does not know the meaning  of unit \\nnumbers. \\n '}, vector=None, shard_key=None, order_value=20),\n",

Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Y outh Protection Mission Statement. \\n True youth protection can be achieved only through the focused commitment of everyone in Scouting. It is the mission of Youth Protection volunteers and professionals to work within the BSA  to maintain a culture of Youth Protection awareness and safety at the national, regional, \\narea, council, district, and unit levels.  2.  BSA Youth Protection Training (YPT).  \\n a.  One does not have to be a registered member of the BSA  to take YPT . \\n b.  To take YPT,  go to  https://my.scouting.org\\n to create an account. An email notification \\nwill be received with account information, including a member ID/reference number. \\n c.  From the  https://my.scouting.org\\n portal, click  Menu then My Dashboard from the menu \\nlist. The My Training page displays to take YPT . Upon successful completion, a training \\ncertificate can be printed . Training will automatically be updated in BSA’s system and \\nassociated with the member ID/reference number issued when the account was created . \\n d.  The Boy Scouts of America places the greatest importance on creating the most secure \\nenvironment possible for BSA  youth members. To maintain such an environment, the \\nBSA developed numerous procedural and leadership selection policies and provides parents and leaders with resources for the Cub Scout, Boy Scout, and Venturing pr ograms.  \\n 3.  Leadership Selection . \\n a.  The BSA  takes great pride in the quality of its  adult leadership. Being a leader in the BSA \\nis a privilege, not a right. The quality of the program and the safety of its  youth members \\ncall for high -quality adult leaders. The BSA work s closely with its chartered organizations \\nto help recruit the best possible leaders for their units.  \\n b.  The  adult application requests background information that should be checked by the unit \\ncommittee or the Chartered O rganization before accepting an applicant for unit leadership. \\nWhile no current screening techniques exist that can identify every potential child abuser, the risk of accepting a child abuser can be reduced by learning as much as possible about an applicant for a leadership position—his or her experience with children, why he or she wants to be a Scout leader, and what discipline techniques he or she would use.

A personal profile and timeli ne are a place \\non Facebook where you can share information (e.g, photos, videos) about \\nyourself. Note that u sing generic or fake identities on  Facebook to create an \\naccount  is a violation of their Terms of Service. If you use a unit name as a \\nprivate timeline na me (which is common practice), you are at risk of having the \\npersonal account removed, which could put the page at risk.  \\n \\n(b)  Reference (b)  guidance is to  not disguise, impersonate , or misrepresent who \\nyou are online. \\n \\n(c)  If you do not al ready have a personal account, you can create an account on \\neither your computer or via the mobile Facebook application on your \\nsmartphone (e.g., android or iPhone). Be aware not  all Facebook features or \\nfunctions work on mobile. \\n \\n(d)  Know the difference between pages and groups. For an official Facebook \\nAuxiliary page, use the \\'page\\' format not the \\'group\\' format. The two \\nformats  have different features and purposes. A \\'page\\' platform is public and \\nallows brands and organizations to introduce their services and activities with a \\nmore professional fact -based method. When someone on Facebook likes or \\nfollows a page, they can start viewing page updates in the newsfeed. A group is a community -based feature that gathers people with the same interests to discuss \\ntopics and share their opinions. Discussions are also welcome on Auxiliary pages if they fall within the guidelines of comment policy.

Youth Protection Reporting Procedures for Volunteers . \\n (1) There are two types of Youth Protection–related reporting procedures all volunteers must follow:  \\n \\n(a)  When one witnesses or suspects any child has been abused or neglected (see “Mandatory Report of Child Abuse” below).  \\n \\n(b)  When one witnesses a violation of the BSA’s Youth Protection policies (see “Reporting Violations of BSA Youth Protection Policies” below).  \\n 6.  Mandatory Report of Child Abuse . \\n \\na. All persons involved in Scouting shall report to local authorities any good- faith suspicion \\nor belief that any child is or has been physically or sexually abused, physically or emotionally neglected, exposed to any form of violence or threat, exposed to any form of sexual exploitation, including the possession, manufacture, or dist ribution of child \\npornography, online solicitation, enticement, or showing of obscene material.

This guide and the Bullying Prevention Guide can be found at : \\nhttps://www.scouting.org/training/youth-\\nprotection/. \\n 8.  Digital Privacy . \\n \\na. A key ingredient for a safe and healthy Scouting experience is the respect for privacy. Advances in technology are enabling new forms of social interaction that extend beyond the appropriate use of cameras or recording devices (see “Scouting’s Barriers to Abuse”).  \\n b. Sending sexually explicit photographs or videos electronically or “sexting” by cell phones is a form of texting being practiced primarily by young adults and children as young as middle-school age. Sexting is neither safe, nor private, nor an approved form of communication and can lead to severe legal consequences for the sender and the receiver.    \\nc. Although most scouts and  leaders use digital devices responsibly, educating them about \\nthe appropriate use of cell phones and cameras would be a good safety and privacy measure. To address cyber -safety education, the BSA has introduced the age- and grade -\\nspecific Cyber Chip program, which addresses topics including cyberbullying, cell-phone use, texting, blogging, gaming, and identity theft.

MMD Endorsements Accompanying Licenses.    \\nEngineers holding licenses that authorize service on inspected vessels of more than 2000 \\nhorsepower are entitled by 46 CFR 12.02- 11(d)(2) to an MMD endorsed for any unlicensed \\nrating in t he engine department. Such license holders should be encouraged to obtain an MMD \\nwhen the license is issued.  In many cases an MMD is required to legally serve aboard a vessel.  (See 46 CFR 12.02- 7). \\n \\nC. Creditable Service.  \\n \\n1. Minimum Vessel Size.    \\nAll servic e must be on vessels of at least 100 gross tons.  This is consistent with the \\nrequirements for ratings as a qualified member of the engine department.  See section 12.C.8 for exceptions for designated duty engineers.  \\n \\n2. Watchstanding Requirements.    \\nTraditio nally, the Coast Guard has held watchstanding experience to be an important part \\nof the professional development of third and second assistant engineers. Technological and design advances over the last several years have led to the development of ships tha t \\ncan operate with unattended engine rooms.  The certificates of inspection for such vessels still require licensed engineers to be on board (the engineer being on call as needed).  Since the engineers are on call, such service shall be treated as though t he license holder \\nwere in charge of a watch and will be creditable for a raise in grade\"\n",
